# Earthquake Prediction Using Machine Learning Models :earthquake:

Welcome to the Earthquake Prediction project! :tada: This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict earthquakes based on historical seismic data. The following sections provide an overview of the project's goals, resources, data preparation, model selection, innovation, and conclusions.

## Project Overview :clipboard:

### Objectives:
- Develop an earthquake prediction model using machine learning.
- Use historical seismic data to train and validate the models.
- Implement interpretable models for real-time monitoring.
- Achieve good prediction results within selected time frames.

## Project Resources :computer:

### Tools and Applications:
- Snowflake: Data Storage (Free)
- Jupyter Notebook: Data Preprocessing (Free)
- Scikit Learn, Keras, TensorFlow: Machine Learning Framework and Library (Free)
- GitHub: Version Control and Repository Storage (Free)
- Tableau Desktop: Visualizations (Free, Student License)
- NumPy, Pandas: Libraries for Data Manipulation (Free)

## Data Preparation :floppy_disk:

The dataset is sourced from the Southern California Earthquake Data Center, comprising earthquake data from 1980 to the present day. The data is collected through seismographic networks, including the US Geological Survey, UC Berkeley, Menlo Park, and USGS. A real-time computer continuously monitors the Earth for seismic signals, which are sent to web pages for remote access. The data is collected from 600 remote locations through radio and landlines.

## Model Selection :bar_chart:

To achieve accurate predictions, SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Network models were chosen due to their capability to handle features such as earthquake magnitude, location, time, and depth. Addressing the imbalanced dataset issue, techniques were applied to improve model performance. Feature importance analysis was conducted to identify critical factors for earthquake prediction, leading to model fine-tuning.

## Innovation :bulb:

- New columns were introduced to capture temporal and spatial earthquake patterns.
- Feature importance analysis identified key predictors, guiding model refinement.
- Improved accuracy and reliability of models for early earthquake prediction.
